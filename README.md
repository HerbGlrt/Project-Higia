  This repository was used to help organize a summer project that some friends and I created! Project Higia was submitted for SpaceApps Challenge 2020, were we designed 
an air filter that could be used both by a regular user on a day-to-day basis as by space agencies such as NASA in the ISS to help improving the air quality.
  Our purifier was made of materials capable of combating Covid-19 and other impurities. In it, a cooler and a sealing system will be used to control the flow of air
to be filtered. This air will be directed to an ultraviolet light that, together with a photocatalyst filter, will exterminate viruses and bacteria through radiation 
and oxidation. After that, it will be guided to a second activated carbon filter, which will retain the remaining impurities. This entire process will be controlled by 
an Arduino system, which will also measure air quality and inform it to the user.
